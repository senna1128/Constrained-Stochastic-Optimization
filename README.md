# Constrained-Stochastic-Optimization
 
This repository contains the codes for implementing the paper  ``An Adaptive Stochastic Sequential Quadratic Programming with
Differentiable Exact Augmented Lagrangians" at https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.05320.pdf. We run 4 StoSQP methods on 47 problems in CUTEst test set. The setup of CUTEst is available at https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers/CUTEst.jl.
